     * Why wrapper classes are used:
     * - Primitives are simple data types
     * - Wrapper classes are objects
     * - Objects can have attributes and behaviors
     * - Wrapper classes allow operations like conversion to String,
     *   hex value, comparison, etc.

    // As technology evolves, older approaches (primitives where objects are needed)
    // are replaced by wrapper classes to support object-oriented features.
